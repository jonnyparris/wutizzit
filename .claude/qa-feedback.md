## These things need fixing

- [] game stats on the homepage are not updating when there are games in progress
- [] game pause doesn't pause the game timer
- [] when there's only one player left in room then game should end and return to homepage
- [] the word should be revealed to everyone when the round is over
- [] the current player drawing should be highlighted in the player list
- [] the character count total is always zero
- [] player list does not update when a player leaves the game
- [] when a player guesses incorrectly the chat message to everyone else says that they guessed correctly
- [] the selectable number of rounds should be a multiple of the number of players so that everyone gets a chance to draw at least once
- [] each game room should have a unique url for others to join
- [] 100 new funny pictionary words should be loaded each day from somewhere
- [] add more cheeky words for generating player names
