## These things need fixing

- [x] game stats on the homepage are not updating when there are games in progres
- [x] when the game owning player leaves then another player should be picked at random to be the game owner
- [x] game owners should have the option to ban players
- [] add a random gif to celebrate the winner of each game. show this in a modal that shows a podium of the top 3 players and their points.
- [] update readme
- [x] set max players per game to 10
- [] allow game owner to set the number of draw words to choose from in the lobby
- [x] dramatically expand the number of words to draw with references from popular culture too
- [] don't repeat any words in a game
- [] load a random image from unsplash in the game lobby canvas while players are waiting to start the game
- [x] add a ticking sound effect for the final 10 seconds of a round
- [] allow game owner to change the round duration in a dropdown: 30, 60, 90, or 180 seconds. Default should be 60.
- [] cleanup any unused code. Refactor for performance where possible with small changes. Nothing too dramatic but feel free to suggest ideas.
