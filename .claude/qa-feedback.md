## These things need fixing

- [] UI still thinks it's always round 1
- [] when all players have left room then game should end
- [] colour picker should be simpler - 12 basic to choose from
- [] game stats and links on homepage should be real and dynamically updated
- [] chat send button overflows container. it shouldn't
- [] summarise scores at the end of the round instead of live
- [] add fun sound effects to actions
- [] the random names should also include celebrity and famous fictional character names, no numbers
